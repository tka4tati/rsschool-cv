### **About Me**

I am not afraid of change, and therefore, after five and a half years of studying at a law school, I set a new goal for myself - to become a Frontend Developer, and for a year now I have been successfully moving towards my goal. I improve my knowledge in web development every day and I'm not going to stop. 

#### **The formula of my work:**

>*Motivation + perseverance + desire to develop + craving for new knowledge + love for development + sense of responsibility for the task done = Real Developer.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Work Experience**

Website development in React JS using the Bootstrap framework and various libraries, such as react-router, react-hook-form, etc. Programs I also worked with during the project: Google Meet, Jira, Confluence, Miro, Figma, GitHub.
